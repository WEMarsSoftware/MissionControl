# Contributing 

This document outlines a guide to new contributors to the repo.

### Choosing Tasks
* Tickets are stored in issues
* When choosing a ticket, make sure to assign yourself to the ticket to let others know that you're working on it


### Development
* To keep the repo clean, we utilize a master and stable branch, as well as personal dev branches
* All development should be done on your personal branch
* Once you're happy, open a pull request to merch to master
* Anything pushed to master must be reviewed by another member 
* Commits are cherry picked to the stable branch

### Coding guidelines
* Not much, just try to keep things consistent :) 
* Also 4 spaces = 1 tab
* camel case 
* feel free to add anything
